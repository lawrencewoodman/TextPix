TextPix
=======
TextPix takes an image and converts it into a redefined character set and text screen data.

History
-------

It was first developed to create pictures for the Jupiter Ace because this computer doesn't have the ability to control each pixel on the screen individually, instead you can only redefine the character set. Therefore I set about seeing if an image could be converted into just the 128 characters plus inverse, that the Ace allows.

Since first writing the program, I have decided to make it more generic so that it will work on other machines. The ultimate aim of doing this on other computers is that it would allow small movies to be displayed by just displaying text with a redefined character set.

Status
------
The program is in very early development at the moment and isn't ready for casual users.  In particular it should be noted that when creating a number of files it doesn't check to see if they already exist.  The program also only creates output files for the Jupiter Ace currently.  While TextPix is fully functional and will convert an image into a format so that it can be displayed on the Jupiter Ace, it is very slow; on my machine it can take up to 6 hours to process one image!

Developers
----------
If you are interested contributing to TextPix then you can find it on GitHub at http://github.com/LawrenceWoodman/TextPix  You can also subscribe to the TextPix Development Mailing List at http://www.freelists.org/list/textpix-dev and the projects homepage is at http://techtinkering.com/projects/textpix

Running
-------
To run TextPix, for the moment, go into the 'src' sub-directory and run:
$ wish textpix.tcl

Load a file through the 'File->Open File To Convert' menu option then click on 'Reduce'.  This will probably take a long time at the moment.  Once it is done it will display the new image and you can click on 'Save ace.byt'.  This will create two files: charset.byt and screen.byt.

If you are using a Jupiter Ace emulator such as xace, you can put these in a directory where xace can find them and then start the emulator.  Within this type the following to load the image:
10240 1024 bload charset 8192 768 bload screen
